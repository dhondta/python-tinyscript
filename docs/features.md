## Metadata

Metadata can be defined using *dunders* (double underscore variables) at the very beginning of the script/tool and is used by Tinyscript to format the help message.

```python
from tinyscript import *

__script__    = "MyScript"
__author__    = "John Doe"
__copyright__ = "John Doe Inc."
__email__     = "john.doe@example.com"
__license__   = "agpl-3.0"
__version__   = "1.0"
__reference__ = "..."
__source__    = "..."
__training__  = "..."
__examples__  = ["..."]
__doc__       = "This tool ..."

initialize()
```

This gives the following help message:

```sh hl_lines="2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 19"
$ python tool.py -h
MyScript v1.0
Author   : John Doe (john.doe@example.com)
Copyright: Â© 2020 John Doe Inc.
License  : GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
Reference: ...
Source   : ...
Training : ...

usage: tool [-h] [-v]

This tool ...

extra arguments:
  -h             show usage message and exit
  --help         show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  verbose mode (default: False)

Usage examples:
  python tool.py ...
```

If not using `__script__`, the name of the script will be used taking a format into account. This format is defined by the `SCRIPTNAME_FORMAT` constant and defaults to "`slugified`". The possible values are:

- `acronym`: split the name on whitespaces, hyphens and underscores then make an acronym from the collected tokens (e.g. "`my-super-script`" becomes "`MSS`")
- `as_is`: do not modify the name
- `none`: equivalent to "`as_is`"
- `slugified`: split the name on whitespaces, hyphens and underscores then capitalize and gather the collected tokens (e.g. "`my-script`" becomes "`MyScript`")

## Help message styling

Help can be formatted using multiple markup languages for making the help text more user-friendly with colors and styling. This is configured by using the `__docformat__` dunder (which can also be `None`, meaning no formatting). This feature is supported by [`mdv`](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer) and the theme can be tuned by using the constant `DOCFORMAT_THEME`.

Currently, the following markup languages are supported: HTML, Markdown, RestructuredText and Textile.

```python hl_lines="2 4"
...
__docformat__ = "html"  # None|"md"|"rst"|"textile"
...
DOCFORMAT_THEME = "Star"
...
```

!!! warning "Various formats support"
    
    The support for HTML, RestructuredText and Textile is based on document conversion with ['pypandoc'](https://pypi.org/project/pypandoc/) to get Markdown before using [`mdv`](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer). In some cases with complex formate text, Pandoc can cause issues with indentation or break the layout. It is then advised to only use Markdown directly to avoid any conversion.

!!! note "List of themes"
    
    Unfortunately, the documentation of [`mdv`](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer) is a bit poor. However, one can find the names of the available themes in [this JSON](https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer/blob/master/mdv/ansi_tables.json).

## Script banner

Displaying a banner can be achieved in two ways:

- by passing a keyword argument `add_banner=True` ; in this case, a random font is used

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initialize(...
               add_banner=True,
               ...)
    ...
```

- by defining the `BANNER_FONT` constant

The `BANNER_STYLE` constant also allows to style the banner with the following properties:

- `adjust`: can be `left` | `center` | `right` ; by default, the banner is centered
- `bgcolor`: determines the background color
- `fgcolor`: determines the foreground color

```python hl_lines="2 3"
...
BANNER_FONT = "roman"
BANNER_STYLE = {'adjust': "right", 'fgcolor': "blue"}
...
```

-----

## Privilege elevation

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `sudo=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              sudo=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This will prompt the user for providing superuser credentials in case of insufficient privileges.

[See example here](examples/sudo.md)

-----

## Multi-level debugging

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `multi_level_debug=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              multi_level_debug=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This modifies the classical `-v`/`--verbose` option to `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv`.

!!! note "Debug levels"

    - '': `logging.ERROR`
    - `-v`: `logging.WARNING`
    - `-vv`: `logging.INFO`
    - `-vvv`: `logging.DEBUG`

[See example here](examples/multi-level-debug.md)

-----

## Extended logging options

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `ext_logging=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              ext_logging=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds multiple options:

- `-f`, `--logfile`: This sets the log filename for saving logging messages.
- `-r`, `--relative`: This sets the log timestamps to the time relative to the start of the execution.
- `-s`, `--syslog`: This allows to save the log messages to `/var/log/syslog` (Linux only).

-----

## Multi-level help

This is achieved by setting the `__details__` metadata at the beginning of the script.

```python hl_lines="2 3 4 5"
    ...
    __details__ = [
    """Extra documentation, displayed when using -hh. """,
    """Other extra documentation, displayed when using -hhh. """
    ]
    ...
    initalize(...)
    ...
```

This modifies the classical `-h`/`--help` option to `-h`/`-hh`/`-hhh`.

!!! note "Help levels"

    - `-h`: classical help message
    - `-hh`: classical help message + first string in __details__ list
    - `-hhh`: classical help message + first and second strings in __details__ list
    
    Note: Strings beyond the two first elements of `__details__` are not handled by purpose.

[See example here](examples/multi-level-help.md)

-----

## Short/Long help

This is enabled by the `short_long_help` parameter of `initialize(...)` and is set to `True` by default.

```python hl_lines="3"
...
initalize(...
          short_long_help=False,
          ...)
...
```

When set to `True`, `-h` only displays usage information and `--help` shows the full help message. If `False`, `-h` and `--help` both displays the full help message.

-----

## Playing a demo

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_demo=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)` and requires that `__examples__` is set as a non-empty list.

```python hl_lines="2 5"
...
__examples__ = ["test", "-sv", "-d --test"]
...
initalize(...
          add_demo=True,
          ...)
...
```

This adds the `--demo` option to pick a random example and execute it.

[See example here](examples/demo.md)

-----

## Stepping the execution

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_step=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It will allow to pause the script/tool where a `step()` function or a `Step(...)` context manager is used when the step mode is enabled.

```python hl_lines="4 5 9 12 14"
...
def my_function(...):
    # do something
    step()
    with Step(at_end=True) as _:
        # this will stop after the execution of the block
...
initalize(...
          add_step=True,
          ...)
...
with Step("this is a first step") as step1:
    # do something
with Step("this is a second step") as step2:
    # do something else
...
```

This adds the `--step` option to enable the step mode.

-----

## Timing the execution

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_time=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It will measure time in the script/tool where a `get_time()` or `get_time_since_last()` function or a `Timer(...)` context manager is used.

```python hl_lines="4 6 11 14 16"
...
def my_function(...):
    # do something
    get_time()
    # do something else
    with Timer(timeout=10) as timer:
        # this will measure time for this block of instructions
        # it will also stop block's execution after 10 seconds
...
initalize(...
          add_time=True,
          ...)
...
with Timer("First block with time measure") as timer1:
    # do something
with Timer("Second block with time measure") as timer2:
    # do something else
...
```

This adds two options:

- `--stats`: The timing statistics will be displayed at the end of the execution.
- `--timings`: Timing information will be displayed where a timing function is called during the execution.

!!! note "Timing functions"
    
    - `get_time(message, start)`: This will measure time since execution start if no `start` value is provided. The default message displayed can be overwritten by setting `message`.
    - `get_time_since_last(message)`: This will measure time since the last measure (either through the use `Timer` or `get_time`/`get_time_since_last`). The default message displayed can be overwritten by setting `message`.
    - `Timer(description, message, timeout, fail_on_timeout)`: This will define a block where the execution time will be measured. A description can be given for display at the beginning of the block. The message can also be overwritten (displayed if the `--timings` option is used at execution). A timeout can be defined to force block's end and a flag can be defined to force `Timeout` exception when a timeout is raised.

-----

## Displaying progress

This can be done by passing a keyword argument `add_progress=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It will allow to display a progress bar where `progressbar` or `progress_manager` is used. This feature relies on the [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) module.

```python hl_lines="3 6"
    ...
    initalize(...
              add_progress=True,
              ...)
    ...
    for i in progressbar(10):
        # do something
    ...
```

This adds the `--progress` option to enable the progress mode.

-----

## Interacting during the execution

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_interact=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It allows to interact with the program during its execution by spawning a Python interpreter. This feature relies on the built-in `code` module.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              add_interact=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds multiple options:

- `--interact`: Enable interaction mode.
- `--host`: Set a remote host for interacting. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
- `--port`: Set a remote port for interacting. Defaults to 12345.

-----

## Starting a wizard

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_wizard=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It will interactively ask for prividing arguments to the script/tool.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              add_wizard=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds the `--wizard` option for enabling the wizard mode.

-----

## Using a configuration INI file

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_config=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It will allow to read/write a configuration INI file with the arguments of the script. This can be useful for passing the right bunch of arguments in a saved file to a colleague or simply if you don't remember how to use your script with a complex configuration.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              add_config=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds two options:

- `-r`, `--read-config`: Filename of the INI file to be read for the input arguments.
- `-w`, `--write-config`: Filename of the INI file where the arguments of the current execution are to be written.

!!! note "If used as a `noarg_action`"
    
    When using this feature as an action when no argument is passed, `config.ini` is used as the default INI filename.

-----

## Adding the version option

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `add_version=[boolean]` to `initialize(...)`. It provides an option to the script/tool for displaying the version from the metadata `__version__`.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              add_version=True,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds the `--version` option for displaying the version from `__version__`.

-----

## Action when no argument given

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `noargs_action="[action]"` to `initialize(...)`. It triggers the related action when no argument is given by the user. It thus overrides the default behavior of argparse, which is to display an error message telling that too few arguments were given.

```python hl_lines="3"
    ...
    initalize(...
              noargs_action="...",
              ...)
    ...
```

!!! note "Available actions"

    It currently supports the following actions:
    
    - [`config`](#using-a-configuration-ini-file)
    - [`demo`](#playing-a-demo)
    - [`help`](#short-long-help)
    - [`interact`](#interacting-during-the-execution)
    - [`step`](#stepping-the-execution)
    - [`time`](#timing-the-execution)
    - [`usage`](#short-long-help)
    - [`version`](#adding-the-version-option)
    - [`wizard`](#starting-a-wizard)

-----

## Easy reporting (Python 3 only)

This is achieved by passing a keyword argument `report_func=[function]` to `initialize(...)`. It allows to trigger a user-provided report generation function which must use Tinyscript's report objects.

```python hl_lines="2 6 7 8 9 14"
...
def make_report():
    # define a list of headers here
    # process a list of data rows
    return (
        Title("Report title"),
        Header("", "Center heading line", ""),
        Footer(),  # will print the page number to the center of the footer
        Table(headers, rows),
    )
...
    ...
    initalize(...
              report_func=make_report,
              ...)
    ...
```

This adds multiple options:

- `--output`: report output format (defaults to `pdf`, see [available formats here](usage.md))
- `--title`: report title
- `--css`: report stylesheet
- `--theme`: report theme (overridden by `--css`)
- `--filename`: report filename

-----

## Customizable exit handlers

Customized handlers can be defined for multiple events:

- *exit*: at the very end of the script/tool
    
```python hl_lines="2"
...
def at_exit():
    # do something at the very end of the script/tool
...
```
      
- *graceful exit*: before *exit*, if everything worked correctly

```python hl_lines="2"
...
def at_graceful_exit():
    # do something before at_exit() if execution succeeded
...
```
      
- *interrupt*: before *exit*, if the user interrupted the script/tool
    
```python hl_lines="2"
...
def at_interrupt():
    # do something before at_exit() if the user interrupted execution
...
```

!!! note "Action at interrupt"
    
    By default, when interrupting the execution, `sys.exit` is triggered therefore stopping the script. This behavior can be changed in several ways by setting `action_at_interrupt` when calling `initialize(...)`. The possible values are:
    
    - `confirm`: ask the user to confirm if the script should exit
    - `continue`: do not interrupt execution
    - `exit`: exit when SIGINT signal is sent

- *terminate*: before *exit*, if the script was terminated from the OS or due to an error
    
```python hl_lines="2"
...
def at_terminate():
    # do something before at_exit() if something went wrong
...
```

Some of these behaviors can be disabled in a block of code using the `DisableSignals` context manager by passing it the signal identifiers.

```python hl_lines="2"
...
with DisableSignals(SIGINT, SIGTERM) as _:
    # do something
    # if an interrupt or termination signal is raised, it will do nothing as
    #  long as we are in this block of code
...
```
